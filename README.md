## HyperQuest Client

Contains the client side code for HyperQuest.
HyperQuest is a web-app used by beginners in ML to easily get a proper intuition for choosing the right hyperparameters. This is initally an extremely daunting task because not having proper hyperparameters lead to the models breaking down.

Started as a project for DSC DAIICT's SLoP. Interested student contributors will get some knowledge of JS (Vanilla / React), Axios/Fetch, etc (maybe something like mobx for state management, mongodb).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
